### Data-Cleaning-EDA-using-SQL
In this project we analyse a dataset we got from 'Real World Fake Data' using SQL then we visualize it using Tableau.

The link to the dataset is attached .

note: They have awesome datasets ! so feel free to choose whatever dataset you want from it, I picked the call-center one.

## Steps I did :

  1. Download the csv file.
  2. Import the file to MySQL
  3. Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
  4. Perform EDA
  5. Visualize it using Tableau.
